        Im Rafael and currently I'm a software engineer at
        <a href="https://www.quorum.us/" target="blank"> Quorum </a>.

      <p>
        When I was a kid around 2004 I started learning HTML, Photoshop and Flash.
        I remember that I also studied javascript and PHP, but I cant honestly say I remember anything.</p>
      <p>
        Learning Action Script was not easy, specially since my english skills were basic null.
        But then I went to the University to study Physics and there I learned a lot about coding.
        Learned the basics of C++ and used a lot of FORTRAN to make scientific simulations
        and mathematical calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I <strong>came back</strong> to javascript and things started to click a lot better.
        Coding is kinda fun.

      <h3>This website</h3>
      <p>
        This is a page where I can try new stuff in a live environment. The previous version of this blog
        was made using Next, because React was the only thing I knew. Now I remade the page using Astro
        because its seemed like a really interesting tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the blog template <a> AstroWind </a>, which uses mdx to autogenerate pages.
        Every page feels like its loading instantaneously,
        probably due to the fact that they use so little javascript. And if there's the need
        for a more complex page I can easily use Svelte.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design was made with the help of <a href="https://v0.dev/r/L2oTkWeLzzc" > V0 </a>, the IA from
        Vercel that <strong> does not </strong> use stolen content.
