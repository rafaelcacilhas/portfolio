Contaja is a small Accountings company from Vi√ßosa - my current town. I worked there as a front-end engineer and made several pages for their new dashboards.

In the six months that I worked there I was able to study and create several Vue pages. I also had the experience to study Angular 2 and make a MVP of the new dashboard using this technology to help decide which of them would be a better fit for the future of the company.
