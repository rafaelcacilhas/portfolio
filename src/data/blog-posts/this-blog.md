## About This Digital Space

This is version 2.0 of my ongoing experiment in building the perfect developer blog/portfolio hybrid. You're looking at an Astro and Svelte-powered rebuild of what began as a simpler static site (complete with questionable color choices), which itself replaced earlier React/Next.js iterations.

### The Evolution

**v0.x**: React/Next.js over-engineering phase

**v1.0**: Minimalist Astro site with vertical nav

**v2.0**: Current iteration (you're here!)

- Astro for static generation
- Svelte for interactive components
- Dark/light mode that actually works
- More than 1 color

### I rebuilt this for three reasons

- To explore Astro's island architecture
- To force myself to learn Svelte properly
- Because apparently I can't stop redesigning my portfolio

### What Lives Here

Blog: Occasional tech musings
Projects: Selected works
Experiments: Half-baked ideas that amused me

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rafaelcacilhas/portfolio) if you enjoy seeing how sausage gets made. Expect frequent tweaks - I treat this site as my perpetual side project sandbox.

Here's a couple of screenshots from **v1.0**:
