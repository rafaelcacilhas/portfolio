I have been learning the basics of Blender. Until a couple of years ago I had no idea how 3D modelling worked; I never thought about how the characters on videogames were actually made.

I have used [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) and [React three fiber](r3f.docs.pmnd.rs) and built some basic
shapes, like an [island](https://github.com/rafaelcacilhas/threejs-island), [earth](https://github.com/rafaelcacilhas/threejs-earth) and a [sphere](https://github.com/rafaelcacilhas/threejs-sphere). It's a very interesting building experience to use HTML semantics to create 3D objects and I plan to keep studying this more and more. These models remind me of using Corel Drawn to make vector art: they are not defined by pixels, but by mathematical figures that can be easily created, translated, rotated and scaled using linear algebra and analytical geometry.

In the last couple of weeks I made my first donut, the "Hello World" of Blender. Since this page is built using Svelte I'll have to learn the basics of [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) to display some of my models. Here you should see my first scene, based on [BlenderGuru's tutorial for Blender 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tbSCMbJA6o); you should be able to move the camera around.
