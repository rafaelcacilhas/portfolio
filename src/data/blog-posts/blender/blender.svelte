    <p>
        The translation from Blender to Threlte is not perfect yet;
        I did not know that I had to export the lights and my sprinkles on the top are missing for some reason.
        
        I also need to better understand how to put several models on the same page using CanvasPortal and CanvasPortalTarget. 
        But letting that aside we can start doing humanoid figures
    </p >
    <Canvas> 
        <Character />
    </Canvas>   
    Thats not terrible, I guess. Going for a more cartoony look we can get something like this
    <Canvas> 
        <Girl />
    </Canvas>    -->
